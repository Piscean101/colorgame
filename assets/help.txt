HOW TO PLAY

At the beginning of each round, after drawing your first card for the turn, you and your opponent may choose up to 2 cards to add to the stage 
from your hand. Once your selection is complete, choose "BATTLE!" to reveal your opponent's staged cards and calculate the results.

DRAW

Once per turn, you or your opponent may choose to draw an additional card for your turn instead of contesting the stage.

COLORS 

Each card has a point value and color value. Each of the 5 colors counters another color, reducing the points both players recieves from card(s)
of that color to 0 for the round. 
Red counters Blue
Blue counters Green
Green counters Yellow
Yellow counters Purple
Purple counters Red

CALCULATION

i. Numbers 
    + If a card was not countered, its player may gain points equal to its value.

ii. Colors
    + Playing 2 cards of the same color together will grant the player 2x points for that round.

example: 

(3,Blue) VS (1,Blue) (2,Red) = +0 VS +2

(1,Green) (1,Green) VS (1,Yellow) (5,Purple) = +4 VS +5
